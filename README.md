![](https://www.pygame.org/docs/_static/pygame_tiny.png)

Mushroom Collector is a simple game made with Python containing specific functions. The goal is to collect non-poisonous mushrooms. A sound effect indicates when multiples of five non-poisonous mushrooms are collected. At the same time, the total number of poisonous (toxic) and non-poisonous (count) mushrooms collected is displayed on the screen. The game ends with an accompanying sound effect if five poisonous mushrooms are collected.

- Poisonous mushrooms: 💀
- Non-poisonous mushrooms: 🍄
